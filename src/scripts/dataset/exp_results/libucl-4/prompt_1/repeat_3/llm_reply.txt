Here is the repaired function:

```c++
else if (*p == '\\' && *(p + 1) != '\\') { // Check if the backslash is not followed by another backslash
	*need_unescape = true;
	ucl_chunk_skipc (chunk, p);
	if (p < chunk->end) {
		ucl_chunk_skipc (chunk, p);
	}
	continue;
}
```

And here is the JSON object explaining the errors and the confidence score:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 1,
      "error_type": "Logic error",
      "explanation": "The condition in the if statement should check if the current character is a backslash and the next character is not a backslash, as backslash sequences are handled differently in C strings."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

This repair addresses the logical error in the condition of the if statement, by checking if the current character is a backslash and the next character is not a backslash. The confidence score is set to 0.95, as this is a common error when dealing with C strings and the proposed fix is well-established and widely used.
