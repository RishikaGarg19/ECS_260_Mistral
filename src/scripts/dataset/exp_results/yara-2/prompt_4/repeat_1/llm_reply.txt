To fix the bug in the given function, we need to correct the condition in the while loop. It seems that the loop should compare two characters at a time, instead of comparing each character with the next character in the string and the next character in the data, which is causing the invalid condition.

Here is the repaired function:

```c
static int _yr_scan_wicompare(
    const uint8_t* data,
    size_t data_size,
    uint8_t* string,
    size_t string_length)
{
  const uint8_t* s1 = data;
  const uint8_t* s2 = string;

  size_t i = 0;

  if (data_size < string_length)
    return 0;

  while (i < string_length && i+1 < string_length && yr_lowercase[*s1] == yr_lowercase[*s2] && yr_lowercase[*s1 + 1] == yr_lowercase[*s2 + 1])
  {
    s1+=2;
    s2+=2;
    i+=2;
  }

  return (int) ((i == string_length/2) ? i : 0);
}
```

Now, let's provide the JSON object with explanations, line number and error type for every error we find:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 7,
      "error_type": "Logic Error",
      "explanation": "The while loop condition should compare two characters at a time, instead of comparing each character with the next character in the string and the next character in the data."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

The confidence score is set to 0.95 based on the simplicity and clear fix of the bug.
