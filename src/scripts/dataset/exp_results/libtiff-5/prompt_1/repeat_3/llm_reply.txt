Explanations:

1. In the original code, the condition in the if statement `if (td->td_planarconfig == PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG) && (td->td_photometric == PHOTOMETRIC_YCBCR) && (!isUpSampled(tif))` is followed by an assignment statement to local variables `samplingblock_samples`, `samplingblocks_hor`, and `samplingblocks_ver`. In the repaired function, these assignments are moved inside the if statement to ensure that they are only executed if the condition is true.

2. In the original code, the call to `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` for `ycbcrsubsampling` is missing the second argument, which is the size of the `ycbcrsubsampling` array. In the repaired function, this argument is added to ensure that the correct amount of memory is allocated.

3. In the original code, the call to `TIFFhowmany_32` in the calculation of `samplingblocks_hor` and `samplingblocks_ver` is missing the first argument, which is the width or height of the image, respectively. In the repaired function, this argument is added to ensure that the correct number of sampling blocks is calculated.

4. In the original code, the call to `TIFFhowmany8_64` in the calculation of `samplingrow_size` is missing the first argument, which is the number of samples in a single row. In the repaired function, this argument is added to ensure that the correct number of bytes is calculated for each row.

5. In the original code, there is a missing semicolon after the return statement in the else block. In the repaired function, this semicolon is added to ensure that the compiler correctly interprets the end of the function.

Confidence: The repaired function should fix the bugs, but there is still a small chance that there are undetected errors or that the function behaves differently than intended in certain edge cases. Therefore, the confidence score is set to 0.95.
