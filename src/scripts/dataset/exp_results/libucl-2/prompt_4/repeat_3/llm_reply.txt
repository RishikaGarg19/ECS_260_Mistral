Here is the repaired function:

```c
else if (*p == '\"') { // Added backslash escape for double quote character
	state = 1;
}
```

And here is the JSON object with explanations and error types:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 5,
      "error_type": "Lexical Error",
      "explanation": "The double quote character in the character constant needs to be escaped with a backslash to be properly represented in the source code."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 1.0
}
```
