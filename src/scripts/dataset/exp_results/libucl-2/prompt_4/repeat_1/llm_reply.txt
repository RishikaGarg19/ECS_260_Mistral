	state = 1;
}
```

JSON Object:

{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 5,
      "error_type": "Mismatched Quotes",
      "explanation": "In C and C++, a double quote within a string literal must be escaped by a backslash. In the buggy function, the condition check was not escaping the double quote, causing a logical error."
