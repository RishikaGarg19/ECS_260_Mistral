Based on the given code snippet, here is the repaired function:

```c++
else if (*p == '\"') {
	state = 1;
}
```

Now, let me provide you with a JSON object explaining the error and my confidence level:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 3,
      "error_type": "Quote Mismatch",
      "explanation": "The double quote character in the conditional statement should be escaped with a backslash character to match the string literal."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

Explanation:
In the buggy function, the double quote character in the condition `(*p == '"')` should be escaped with a backslash character to match the string literal in C and C++. This will prevent a potential syntax error when the compiler encounters the double quote character in the conditional statement. The error type in this case is "Quote Mismatch". I am confident (95%) about this repair, but please test the code to ensure its correctness in your specific context.
