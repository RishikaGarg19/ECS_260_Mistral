Here's the repaired function:

```c++
else if (*p == '\"') { // Use a backslash to escape the double quote character in the comparison
	state = 1;
}
```

Now, let me provide you with the JSON object containing the explanations, line number, and error type of the error found in the buggy function:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 4,
      "error_type": "Mismatched Quotes",
      "explanation": "In the buggy function, the double quote character in the comparison operator was not escaped, resulting in a syntax error."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 1.0
}
```

This JSON object indicates that there is a single error located on line 4 of the function, which is an issue with mismatched quotes. The explanation explains that the double quote character in the comparison operator was not escaped, which resulted in a syntax error. The confidence score is set to 1.0, indicating that the repair solution is highly confident.
