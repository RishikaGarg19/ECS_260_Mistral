Here's the repaired function:

```c++
else if (*p == '\\'' || *p == '\"') { // Escaped character or double quote
    state = 1;
}
```

And here's the JSON object with explanations, line number, and error type for the detected errors:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 2,
      "error_type": "LogicError",
      "explanation": "The original code checks only for double quotes, but it should also check for escaped single quotes."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```
