I have identified two errors in the buggy function:

1. The first argument of `sigaction` function should be a pointer to `sigaction` struct, but in the function it is passed as a constant integer `sigaction`.
2. The variable `sigaction` is not defined in the function.

Here is the repaired function:

```c++
#include <signal.h>
#include <gcov.h> // For __gcov_flush()

struct sigaction dpp_orig_sigaction;

void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	__gcov_flush();
	if (sigaction(SIGACTION, &dpp_orig_sigaction, NULL) < 0) {
		perror("Error restoring previous signal handler");
		exit(1);
	}
	raise(signum);
	exit(1);
}
```

JSON object with explanations, line numbers, and error types:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 3,
      "error_type": "Function call with incorrect argument",
      "explanation": "The first argument of sigaction function should be a pointer to sigaction struct, but in the function it is passed as a constant integer sigaction."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 5,
      "error_type": "Undefined variable",
      "explanation": "The variable sigaction is not defined in the function."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

Confidence: The confidence score for the repair is 0.95, as the errors identified are clear-cut and the suggested fix is a common practice. However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on the given code snippet and doesn't take into account the context of the whole program.
