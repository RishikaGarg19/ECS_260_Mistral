Repaired function:
```c
#include <signal.h>

void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	__gcov_flush();
	sigaction(signum, &dpp_orig_sigaction, NULL);
	raise(signum);
	exit(1);
}
```
Explanation:

The bug in the function is that the first argument of `sigaction` is not `signum`. Instead, it is `sigaction`, which is likely the name of the `struct sigaction` variable. The correct argument should be the signal number that the handler wants to act upon.

Here is the JSON object with the explanation:
```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 5,
      "error_type": "Wrong argument passed to function",
      "explanation": "The first argument of sigaction should be the signal number, but sigaction is passed instead."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 99
}
```
Confidence: I am 99% confident that this is the correct fix for the bug.
