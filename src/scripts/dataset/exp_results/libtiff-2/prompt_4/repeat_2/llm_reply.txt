Repaired function:
```c
void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	__gcov_flush();
	sigaction(signum, &dpp_orig_sigaction, NULL);
	raise(signum);
	exit(1);
}
```

      "line_number": 4,

The error in the provided code is a function parameter usage error. The `sigaction` function takes three arguments: the first is the signal number, the second is a pointer to the `sigaction` structure, and the third is a pointer to the previous handler. The buggy code was passing the `sigaction` structure as the first argument, which is incorrect. The correct code passes the signal number (`signum`) as the first argument and the `sigaction` structure (`&dpp_orig_sigaction`) as the second argument.
