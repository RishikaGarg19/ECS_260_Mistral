Here is the repaired function:

```c
if (obj->keylen > 0) {
    func->ucl_emitter_append_len (obj->key, obj->keylen, func->ud);
}
```

And here is the JSON object with explanations, line numbers, and error types for the bugs found in the original function:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 2,
      "error_type": "Misplaced else",
      "explanation": "The else keyword is misplaced in this if statement. It should be removed or moved to the correct position."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 1.0
}
```

Explanation:

The original function had a misplaced else statement on line 2. It should be removed or moved to the correct position to fix the bug.

The confidence score is set to 1.0 because the fix is straightforward and the error is clear-cut. However, in practice, the confidence score could be lower if there were other potential issues or ambiguities in the code.
