Here is the repaired function:

```c
else if (c == '$' && !*var_expand) {
    *var_expand = true;
}
```

And here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 4,
      "error_type": "Logical error",
      "explanation": "Assignment to *var\_expand should only occur if *var\_expand is currently false, otherwise it will result in an infinite loop if the '$' character is encountered multiple times."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

Explanation:
The logical error in the buggy function is that the assignment to `*var_expand` is not protected by a check to ensure that it is currently false. If the `'$'` character is encountered multiple times in the input, this will result in an infinite loop, since `*var_expand` will be set to `true` every time, and will never be reset to `false`. The repair adds a check for `!*var_expand` before the assignment, to ensure that it only occurs when necessary. The confidence score is 0.9, since this is a common type of error and the repair is straightforward.
