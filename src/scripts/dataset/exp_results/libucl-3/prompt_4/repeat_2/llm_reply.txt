Repaired function:
```c
else if (c == '$' && *format_ptr != '\0') {
    *var_expand = true;
}
```
Explanation:

The original code did not check if the `format_ptr` pointer is pointing to a null character before attempting to dereference it. This could lead to a segmentation fault if `format_ptr` is null. The repaired code adds a check for this condition before dereferencing `format_ptr`.

JSON response:
```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 4,
      "error_type": "Null pointer dereference",
      "explanation": "The original code did not check if the format_ptr pointer is pointing to a null character before attempting to dereference it. This could lead to a segmentation fault if format_ptr is null. The repaired code adds a check for this condition before dereferencing format_ptr."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```
Note: The line number in the JSON response corresponds to the line number of the original code in the problem statement. The confidence score is a measure of how confident the tool is that the proposed repair is correct. In this case, the confidence score is 0.95, indicating a high level of confidence in the proposed repair.
