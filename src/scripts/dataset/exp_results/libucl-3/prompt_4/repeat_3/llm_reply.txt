Here is the repaired function:

```c
else if (c == '$' && !(*var_expand)) {
    *var_expand = true;
}
```

And here is the JSON object with the explanation and confidence score:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 3,
      "error_type": "Logical error",
      "explanation": "The variable `*var_expand` is not checked before being set to true, which could lead to unexpected behavior if it is already true."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

Explanation: The original code sets the variable `*var_expand` to true if the character `c` is equal to `$`. However, there is no check to see if `*var_expand` is already true before setting it to true again. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, depending on how the `*var_expand` variable is used elsewhere in the code. To fix this, I added the condition `!(*var_expand)` to the `if` statement, so that `*var_expand` will only be set to true if it is currently false.

I am confident that this is the correct fix for the logical error in the code, but there is a small chance that there are other factors at play that I am not aware of, so I have given a confidence score of 0.95.
