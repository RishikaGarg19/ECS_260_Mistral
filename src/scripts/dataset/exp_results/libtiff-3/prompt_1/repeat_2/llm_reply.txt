Based on the given function, there are no apparent syntax errors or potential security vulnerabilities. However, the function's behavior might not be as expected, and it seems to be mixing different programming paradigms (C and C++). Here's the suggested fix:

```c++
#include <csignal>
#include <cstdlib> // For std::exit()

void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	__gcov_flush();
	std::signal(signum, sig_handler); // Assuming sig_handler is defined elsewhere
	std::raise(signum);
	std::exit(1);
}
```

The JSON object explaining the changes:

```json
{
  "error": [],
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

Explanations:

1. Replaced `sigaction` with `std::signal`.
2. Assumed that `sig_handler` is defined elsewhere in the code and just replaced `sigaction` with it.
3. Replaced `exit(1)` with `std::exit(1)` for consistency with the `std::signal` function.

The confidence score is set to 0.9 because the fix assumes that `sig_handler` is already defined elsewhere in the code. If it's not, the program will not compile, and a more significant change would be required.
