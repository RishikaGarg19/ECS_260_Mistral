Based on the provided code, there are no apparent syntax errors or potential security vulnerabilities. However, there are some issues that can be improved for better programming practices. Here's the suggested fix and an explanation of the changes:

Repaired function:
```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h> // For perror() and exit()

// Declare a static variable to store the original signal handler
static struct sigaction dpp_orig_sigaction;

void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	__gcov_flush();

	// Save the current signal handler
	if (sigaction(signum, NULL, &dpp_orig_sigaction) < 0) {
		perror("Error saving signal handler");
		exit(1);
	}

	// Call the original signal handler
	if (sigaction(signum, &dpp_orig_sigaction, NULL) < 0) {
		perror("Error calling signal handler");
		exit(1);
	}
}
```

Now, let me provide you with the JSON object containing explanations, line numbers, and error types for the changes made:
