Here's the repaired function:

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <gcov.h> // Assuming gcov.h is required for __gcov_flush()

void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	__gcov_flush(); // Flush gcov coverage data

	// Save the original signal handling action
	struct sigaction dpp_orig_sigaction;
	sigaction(SIGACTION, &dpp_orig_sigaction, NULL);

	// Restore the original signal handling action
	sigaction(SIGACTION, &dpp_orig_sigaction, NULL);

	// Handle the signal
	switch (signum) {
		case SIGSEGV:
		case SIGABRT:
		case SIGFPE:
		case SIGBUS:
			// Provide proper error handling here
			break;
		default:
			// Handle other signals as required
			break;
	}
}

// Assuming SIGACTION is defined as SIGINT or another valid signal number
#define SIGACTION SIGINT
```

Now, let's provide explanations, line numbers, and error types for the issues found in the buggy function:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 1,
      "error_type": "Undefined preprocessor macro: <<< Buggy function:",
      "explanation": "The function definition should start with the actual function name."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 2,
      "error_type": "Undefined identifier: __gcov_flush",
      "explanation": "Assuming gcov.h is required for __gcov_flush(), make sure it is included."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 3,
      "error_type": "Undefined identifier: SIGACTION",
      "explanation": "SIGACTION should be replaced with the actual signal number (e.g., SIGINT) used in sigaction()."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 5,
      "error_type": "Missing case statements for signal numbers other than SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, SIGFPE, and SIGBUS",
      "explanation": "Proper error handling should be provided for other signal numbers as required."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 6,
      "error_type": "Exiting the program with exit(1) after handling a signal is generally not a good practice",
      "explanation": "Instead, the program should be allowed to continue execution after handling the signal."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

The confidence score is based on the assumption that the provided function is intended to handle signals. However, it might not be the ideal solution for specific use cases. Adjustments may be required depending on the exact requirements of the project.
