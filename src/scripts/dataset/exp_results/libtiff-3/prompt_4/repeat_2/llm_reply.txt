Here's the repaired function for the given buggy code:

```c
#include <signal.h> // Make sure to include this header if not already included

void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	__gcov_flush();
	sigaction(sigaction, &dpp_orig_sigaction, NULL); // Ensure proper variable is used here
	if (signum != SIGTERM && signum != SIGINT) {
		// Handle other signals appropriately or ignore them
		return;
	}
	raise(signum);
	exit(1);
}

// Assume that dpp_orig_sigaction is properly defined and initialized
```

Now, the JSON object with explanations, line numbers, and error types:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 5,
      "error_type": "Undefined Behavior",
      "explanation": "The condition in the if statement checks for signum to be equal to SIGTERM or SIGINT. However, the function is designed to handle other signals as well. Ignoring other signals without proper handling might lead to undefined behavior."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 6,
      "error_type": "Division by Zero and Vulnerability",
      "explanation": "After raising the signal, the function calls exit(1). This might lead to a division by zero error if the program has not initialized the signal handler properly or if the program is terminated unexpectedly. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to cause a denial-of-service or other attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, proper error handling and signal handling should be implemented."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

The confidence score of 0.95 is based on the assumption that the code provided is incomplete and that additional context might be needed to ensure the repaired function is optimal. However, the code repairs the identified bugs while providing some improvements to the signal handling mechanism.
