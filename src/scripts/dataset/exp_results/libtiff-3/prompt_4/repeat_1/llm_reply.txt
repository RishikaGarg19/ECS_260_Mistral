The bug in the function is causing two errors: omission of checking for a valid sigaction pointer and division by zero due to uninitialized sigaction. Here's the repaired function:

```c
void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	struct sigaction dpp_orig_sigaction;
	__gcov_flush();
	if (sigaction(SIGACTION, &dpp_orig_sigaction, NULL) < 0) {
		perror("sigaction failed");
		exit(1);
	}
	sigaction(signum, NULL, &dpp_orig_sigaction);
	exit(1);
}
```

Now, let's provide the JSON object with explanations, line numbers, and error types for every error found:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 3,
      "error_type": "Uninitialized variable",
      "explanation": "The variable 'dpp_orig_sigaction' is used without being initialized before."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 5,
      "error_type": "Division by zero",
      "explanation": "The function 'sigaction' is called without checking if it returned successfully. If it fails, 'dpp_orig_sigaction' is used in the next line, which can result in division by zero."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

This JSON object indicates that there are two errors in the function, one at line 3 (Uninitialized variable) and another at line 5 (Division by zero). The confidence score is set to 0.95 as the repair seems to address the issues correctly.
