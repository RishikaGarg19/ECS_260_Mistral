To fix the bugs in the function `dpp_sighandler`, we need to handle the division by zero error and the omission error. We will add error checking for the division operation and also initialize the `sigaction` struct before using it.

Here's the repaired function:

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <gcov.h> // For __gcov_flush()

void dpp_sighandler(int signum) {
	struct sigaction sigaction;
	__gcov_flush();

	// Initialize sigaction struct
	sigaction.sa_handler = SIG_DFL; // Default signal handler
	sigaction.sa_flags = 0;

	// Check for division by zero error
	if (signum == 0) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Error: Division by zero\n");
		exit(1);
	}

	// Perform original signal handling
	sigemptyset(&sigaction.sa_mask);
	sigaction(signum, &sigaction, NULL);
}
```

Now, let's provide the JSON response with explanations, line numbers, and error types:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 7,
      "error_type": "Division by zero",
      "explanation": "The original code did not check for division by zero before performing the division operation, leading to an error."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 5,
      "error_type": "Omission error",
      "explanation": "The original code did not initialize the sigaction struct before using it, leading to undefined behavior."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

The confidence score is set to 0.95 as the bugs identified are straightforward and the proposed solution effectively resolves the issues.
