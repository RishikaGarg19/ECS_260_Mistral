Here is the repaired function:

```c++
if (td->td_photometric == PHOTOMETRIC_SEPARATED && td->td_samplesperpixel == 4) {
	if (td->td_bitspersample == 8) {
		sp->cinfo.c.input_components = 4;
		sp->cinfo.c.in_color_space = JCS_CMYK;
	} else {
		sp->cinfo.c.input_components = 12;
		sp->cinfo.c.in_color_space = JCS_RGB;
	}
} else {
	sp->cinfo.c.input_components = 1;
	sp->cinfo.c.in_color_space = JCS_UNKNOWN;
}

if (!TIFFjpeg_set_defaults(sp))
	return (0);

/* Set per-file parameters */
switch (sp->photometric) {
case PHOTOMETRIC_YCBCR:
	sp->h_sampling = td->td_ycbcrsubsampling[0];
	sp->v_sampling = td->td_ycbcrsubsampling[1];

	/*
	 * A ReferenceBlackWhite field *must* be present since the
	 * default value is inappropriate for YCbCr.  Fill in the
	 * proper value if application didn't set it.
	 */
	if (!TIFFGetField(tif, TIFFTAG_REFERENCEBLACKWHITE, NULL) || !TIFFGetField(tif, TIFFTAG_XRESOLUTION, NULL) || !TIFFGetField(tif, TIFFTAG_YRESOLUTION, NULL)) {
		float refbw[6], xres, yres;
		long top = 1L << td->td_bitspersample;

		refbw[0] = 0;
		refbw[1] = (float)(top-1L);
		refbw[2] = (float)(top>>1);
		refbw[3] = refbw[1];
		refbw[4] = refbw[2];
		refbw[5] = refbw[1];

		if (!TIFFSetField(tif, TIFFTAG_REFERENCEBLACKWHITE, refbw, sizeof(refbw)))
			return (0);

		if (!TIFFGetField(tif, TIFFTAG_XRESOLUTION, &xres) || !TIFFGetField(tif, TIFFTAG_YRESOLUTION, &yres)) {
			TIFFSetField(tif, TIFFTAG_XRESOLUTION, 72.f);
			TIFFSetField(tif, TIFFTAG_YRESOLUTION, 72.f);
		}
	}
}
```

And here's the JSON object with explanations, line numbers, and error types:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 11,
      "error_type": "Assignment to incompatible type",
      "explanation": "In the original code, the variable 'ref' of type 'float *' is assigned to NULL, but in the corrected code, it is assigned to NULL and an empty array 'refbw' of type 'float[6]' when TIFFGetField fails. To make the types compatible, the assignment to 'ref' should be changed to 'refbw' instead."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 14,
      "error_type": "Implicit declaration of function",
      "explanation": "The functions TIFFSetField and TIFFGetField are used in the code but not declared before they are called. To fix this error, add '#include <tiff.h>' at the beginning of the file or declare the functions at the beginning of the file."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 18,
      "error_type": "Division by zero",
      "explanation": "In the original code, the condition '!TIFFGetField(tif, TIFFTAG_REFERENCEBLACKWHITE, &ref)' is not checked before trying to access the 'top' variable. In the corrected code, the condition is checked before assigning the value of 'top' to 'refbw[1]'. To avoid division by zero, this check is necessary."
    }
  ],

This JSON object explains the errors and their line numbers, with the confidence level set to 0.95.
