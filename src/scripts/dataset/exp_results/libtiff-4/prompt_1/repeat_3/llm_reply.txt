Here is the repaired function:

```c++
if (td->td_photometric == PHOTOMETRIC_SEPARATED && td->td_samplesperpixel == 4) {
    sp->cinfo.c.input_components = 4;
    sp->cinfo.c.in_color_space = JCS_CMYK;
} else {
    sp->cinfo.c.input_components = 1;
    sp->cinfo.c.in_color_space = JCS_UNKNOWN;
}

if (!TIFFjpeg_set_defaults(sp))
    return 0;

/* Set per-file parameters */
switch (sp->photometric) {
case PHOTOMETRIC_YCBCR:
    sp->h_sampling = td->td_ycbcrsubsampling[0];
    sp->v_sampling = td->td_ycbcrsubsampling[1];

    /* A ReferenceBlackWhite field *must* be present since the
       default value is inappropriate for YCbCr.  Fill in the
       proper value if application didn't set it. */
    if (!TIFFGetField(tif, TIFFTAG_REFERENCEBLACKWHITE, NULL)) {
        float refbw[3][3] = {{0, (float)(1L << td->td_bitspersample), (float)(1L << td->td_bitspersample >> 1)},
                             {(float)(1L << td->td_bitspersample), 0, (float)(1L << td->td_bitspersample >> 1)},
                             {(float)(1L << td->td_bitspersample >> 1), (float)(1L << td->td_bitspersample >> 1), 0}};
        TIFFSetField(tif, TIFFTAG_REFERENCEBLACKWHITE, refbw, sizeof(refbw));
    }
    break;
default:
    sp->h_sampling = td->td_xresolution;
    sp->v_sampling = td->td_yresolution;
    break;
}
```

Now, the JSON object with explanations, line numbers, and error types for every error found:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 10,
      "error_type": "Undefined variable 'ref'",
      "explanation": "The variable 'ref' is not defined before it's used in this if statement."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 11,
      "error_type": "Implicit declaration of variable 'refbw'",
      "explanation": "The variable 'refbw' is implicitly declared and its size is not specified."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 12,
      "error_type": "Invalid type comparison",
      "explanation": "The comparison between 'float' and 'long' is not valid. 'refbw' should be an array of 'float'."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 15,
      "error_type": "Undefined constant 'JCS_CMYK'",
      "explanation": "The constant 'JCS_CMYK' is not defined in the given context."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 16,
      "error_type": "Undefined constant 'JCS_UNKNOWN'",
      "explanation": "The constant 'JCS_UNKNOWN' is not defined in the given context."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

The confidences of the repaired function is 0.85. This means that the tool is quite confident in the suggested repairs but further testing is recommended to ensure the accuracy and functionality of the code.
