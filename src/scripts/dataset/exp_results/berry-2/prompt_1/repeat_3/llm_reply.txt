I see several issues in the given function. Here is the repaired function:

```c++
static void code_not(bfuncinfo *finfo, bexpdesc *e)
{
    switch (e->type) {
    case ETINT: e->v.i = !e->v.i; break;
    case ETREAL: e->v.i = !e->v.r; break;
    case ETNIL: e->v.i = 0; break;
    case ETBOOL: e->v.i = !e->v.i; break;
    case ETSTRING: e->v.i = 0; break;
    default: {
        // Swap operands and negate the operator
        bexpdesc temp = *e;
        e->op.right = e->op.left;
        e->op.left = temp.op.right;
        e->op.op = NOT_EXPR;
        return;
    }
    }

    e->type = ETBOOL;
}
```

Now, let me explain the errors I found and provide their line numbers and error types:

```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 9,
      "error_type": "Misplaced assignment",
      "explanation": "In the default case, you are assigning values to e->t and e->f without initializing them. Instead, you should declare and initialize temp before the assignment."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 11,
      "error_type": "Inconsistent types",
      "explanation": "In the default case, you are trying to assign a boolean value to an integer variable e->v.i. Instead, you should store the result of the not operation in a boolean variable and return it."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 14,
      "error_type": "Missing semicolon",
      "explanation": "There is no semicolon after the return statement in the default case."
    },
    {
      "line_number": 15,
      "error_type": "Inconsistent variable assignment",
      "explanation": "You are assigning EtBool to e->type, which is an integer type. Instead, you should assign ETBOOL constant to e->type."
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

The confidence score is set to 0.95 as the repairs are based on logical analysis and common coding practices. However, there might be cases where the repaired code does not fully address the intended functionality of the original code. Always remember to test the repaired code to ensure that it meets the desired requirements.
